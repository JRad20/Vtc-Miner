# Vtc-Miner

Hey guys, I've been mining vertcoin recently and there were a few issues that I was having with the OCM & Vert (usability wise) so I went ahead and made my own version. It's basically just a nice clean easy to use GUI for VerthashMiner. I also have more advanced features that the current OCM does not have in the works. If you would like to support this project and future updates please send donations to VqFsXZwN94882ZJcdMPhHPWStaqV3UJQMh

<h2>Installation</h2>
